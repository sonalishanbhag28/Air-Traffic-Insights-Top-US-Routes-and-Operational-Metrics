# Air Traffic Insights Dashboard
This project presents a dashboard created completely using Tableau, which visualizes key flight statistics, cancellation trends, major flight routes, and operational performance for U.S. air traffic.

**Data Source**: The dashboard uses data from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays?select=flights.csv.â€‹ `Final-Dashboard-v1.pdf` is an export of the completed Tableau dashboard.

### Features
- Created and visualized 100% in Tableau
- Summary of total flights, cancellation rates, delays, and diversions
- U.S. route map showing busiest flight connections
- Visual breakdown of cancellation reasons and monthly trends
- Analysis of fastest routes by airline and duration
- Seasonal and weekly flight density patterns
- Airline market share on busy routes

### Key Learnings
1. Build dashboards completely in Tableau, transforming raw CSV data into interactive visual insights.
2. Implement dynamic "Top N" filters using parameters and calculated fields, allowing viewers to customize dashboard views and focus on the top routes, airlines, or metrics of interest.
3. Create geographic charts in Tableau, visually mapping airport connections and analyzing spatial flight data.
4. Use calculated fields to enable custom logic, dynamic ranking, field categorization, and advanced filtering for clearer, actionable analysis.
